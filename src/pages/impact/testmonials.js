                    We appreciate the overwhelming support we gave to these cause. Unilucy had a blood brother whom they   were candidates together.
                    With Murang’a County Governor’s support of KES 15,000 and the funds you contributed, we managed to pay Unilucy’s fees at  Nginda Girls High School for the whole year 2023.
                    Her brother, Kiama, joined Ikumbi High School. He was bought  for school uniform and we paid some school fees for the first term.
                    A balance of KES 48,120 was deposited in the KMDO Bank account and a vote head of Unilucy Education Fund was opened to pay future school fees for her.
                    Thank you all for responding  positively to this noble course of educating the future of our community.

                    The Muturu Mwangi family covets to send an appreciatory message to Karinga Massive Development Organization for their nod of affection showcased when they visited and spent ample time with granny. We beg your pardon by reason the person who was to meet with ( Muturu Mwangi ) could not make it as he is currently admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. Hope this finds you positively.
                    May God shower you with endless blessings.
