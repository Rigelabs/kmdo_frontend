                <Card.Text>
                  Every year, KMDO representatives give motivational talks to learners in the examination year in primary and high schools.
                   The learners are also given educational materials such as geometrical sets, erasers, pencils and pens. When examination results
                    are released, KMDO rewards best performing candidates and the teachers whose subjects were performed well.
